# üëã Thanks for having me

### My name is Jung-Hoon Cho.

- üî≠ I am Ph.D. student in [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Cathy Wu](http://wucathy.com/). I received BS and MS in CEE from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) in South Korea.

- üå± My research interest is in three-folds.
    - üõ£Ô∏è Efficient traffic control strategy under CAV condition and mixed autonomy traffic
    - üöã New emerging smart mobility
    - üìä Urban Data Intelligence & Machine learning
- For details, please visit my [personal website](http://www.junghooncho.com).
